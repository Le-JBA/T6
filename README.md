## Instructions:

Unscrew the front bezel of the T6, keep the glass lens and the gasket and put them aside for later. The reflector will not be used.

Desolder the MCPCB and remove it from the flashlight, this also won't be used.

Pull out the cables to full length. If the cables are too short, you may need to replace them with longer 20 AWG cables on the driver PCB.

You may want to replace the cooling paste, if so, do this now.

Place the adapter in the flashlight so the holes at the bottom line up with the cutouts in the adapter, and make sure the cables go all the way to the top.

Place additional cooling paste on the adapter, and then place the MCPCB on top.

Solder red cable to + and black cable to -.

Place the Convoy 7070 gasket on the MCPCB.

Place the 3D printed gasket on top of the Convoy gasket.

Screw the bezel back together with the front lens and the gasket.
